        <h1>About OrthologExplore</h1>
        <p>  <!-- Paragraph explaining what orthologs are -->
          This website is dedicated to exploring orthologs — genes in different species that derive from the same ancestral gene.
          Although species diverge, orthologous genes frequently retain similar functions. Orthologs are essential for understanding
          evolutionary relationships, how genes change over time, and which biological functions are conserved across life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to provide an accessible and organized resource for anyone interested in comparative genomics, evolutionary
          biology, or gene function analysis. To maintain high quality and reliable results, we include only ortholog datasets that
          contain more than 1,000 genes. Focusing on larger gene sets strengthens evolutionary signals, produces more meaningful
          comparisons, and reduces noise from small or incomplete datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using substantial gene collections, we aim to deliver clearer insights into gene relationships across species, support
          research efforts, and offer a helpful starting point for students, scientists, and curious users. The site is designed for
          simplicity and ease of use, even for those new to the topic.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting — we hope this resource helps you explore the fascinating world of orthologs and genomics.</p>

          <li><strong>Graph</strong>: only the top, most ortholog‑dense diseases are taken into account; nodes are diseases, radius shows number of GO terms, and edges are Jaccard similarities between disease GO sets.</li>
          <li><strong>Bar plot</strong>: species with fewer than 1,000 ortholog genes are filtered out via the SPARQL query.</li>
          <li><strong>GO annotations</strong>: only GO biological process annotations are used — these are the annotations most relevant for the project purpose.</li>
          <li><strong>Data source</strong>: all data is fetched from Wikidata via its public SPARQL endpoint.</li>
